# Guardian

Guardian is a crime mapping tool with its applications spanning
not only to just report a crime but also actively mapping the severity and locality of the said incident.
With the help of our app, citizens can report crimes of various types with just a push of a button.
Sure, there exists a number of systems to achieve the above goal. But, the most unique feature of this
project is that, it is built around the paradigms that it will be government controlled so there can be
no misuse of identity which is the biggest flaw in the present systems.
Also, this app is built heavily around the idea of real time activity monitoring. This will help the
concerned authorities to not only identify the type of threat but also scale the forces to be dispatched
in order to counter the reported activity which will minimize the infrastructural constraints and
maximize the efficiency rate in dealing of these problems.
After the crime has been resolved, the activity can be released to the general public after the approval
of concerned authorities and will be displayed on the map with redacted details in order to maintai
